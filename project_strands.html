            <h3>Narrative CVs</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Using ‘Narrative CVs’ in recruitment is intended to move away from an overreliance on publication lists
              and grant awards. The project will quantify how different CV formats affect the shortlisting of research
              applicants alongside studying applicants and recruiters experience of those different formats. This will 
              build an evidence base for the potential for narrative CVs to drive positive culture change.
            </p>
            <p class="text"></p>
              An example narrative CV template, based on the Royal Society’s “Résumé for Research” can be downloaded XXX

            <h3>Tools for Development Conversations</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text"></p>
              A number of challenges in research culture relate to a lack of opportunities for researchers to discuss their
              professional development, formally and informally, in an open and honest way with the academics that manage them,
              and others they work with. This project will explore a range of tools and approaches that support these kinds of 
              conversations, trial them on participants engaged in professional development programmes, and help researchers get, 
              give and receive feedback on their research leadership skills.
            </p>
            <h3>Precarity in Academic Careers</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Precarity in early research careers caused by short fixed-term contracts is one of the major issues cited by the community
              as leading to challenges in research culture. The problem is complex, and many discussions of the issue fail to take account
              of the many constraints on, and within, the research system. This project will develop an understanding of how early career
              researchers make choices about their research career; how principal investigators make recruitment decisions and; how the variety
              of research posts has changed over time. The findings will lead to a better understanding of the different solutions available for
              addressing questions of precarity or mitigating its worst impacts.
