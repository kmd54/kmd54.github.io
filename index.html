              investigating how changing the recruitment, development and retention of researchers

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Improving research culture – the norms, values and behaviours of researchers and the research system 
              is a key to revitalising research and increasing its contribution to society. The Action Research on 
              Research Culture (ARRC) project investigates how changing the recruitment, development and retention
              of researchers could improve research culture.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Numerous empirical studies, reports and surveys point to problems in the culture of academic research. 
              These include an over-reliance on inappropriate metrics, poor leadership and management, a lack of job 
              security, unhealthy competition, and poor inter-team relationships. These problems lead to a loss of talent 
              and diversity from the sector, and a consequent loss of quality and creativity in research.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Various solutions to these problems have been proposed and the ARRC project will test three approaches intended
              to improve research culture. The findings will be used to develop relevant frameworks, policies and materials to 
              ensure effective approaches are embedded in institutions and produce sustainable long term change.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The ARRC project is an international project, led by the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with the University
               of Edinburgh (UK), Leiden University (The Netherlands), Freie Universität Berlin (Germany), and ETH Zurich (Switzerland). 
               As the project progresses the empirical research will be developed with and extended to partner institutions.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The project is co-led by Liz Simmonds, the Head of Research Culture, and Steve Wooding, from the Research Strategy Office.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The project team encompasses a balance of skills to enable them to: engage with researchers and other stakeholders in the 
              research system; understand the context of the different institutions, circumstances, and disciplines, and; carry out high-quality, 
              robust research, to produce the resources that individuals, and the sector, can use to improve practice.
