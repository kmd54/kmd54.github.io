          <p class="text">
            Liz is the Head of Research Culture at the University of Cambridge, responsible for driving
            the research culture agenda across the institution. She supports the Research Culture Steering
            Committee in setting the strategy and establishing the priorities for research culture. She manages
            the Action Research on Research Culture project, and chairs the Research Culture Operational Group, 
            to ensure the delivery of a range of activities that support an improved research culture at Cambridge.
            She also works with universities, funders and other stakeholders nationally and internationally to help 
            build a collaborative approach to tackling research culture across the Higher Education sector.
            Liz has worked at the University of Cambridge for 15 years, primarily in roles supporting early career 
            researchers. She co-established the University’s first Careers Service for Postdocs in 2007, offering 
            individual support for researchers facing some of the biggest challenges in research culture. She then
            moved to Assistant Head of the Postdoc Academy in 2019, where she led the development of the University’s
            broader research culture agenda, including the first institutional action plan. Prior to joining the University,
            she held various roles in science communication and policy.

            <p class="text">
              Dr Steven Wooding is Head of Research on Research in the Research Strategy Office at the University of Cambridge,
              a Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for Science Policy and a Senior Research Associated at the Intellectual 
              Forum at Jesus College. His central research interest is how research itself works: from funding processes; to the
              social machinery of research and the wider impact of research. He has recently looked at the evidence behind using
              peer review for funding allocation, and worked with foundations to develop improved methods of selecting research
              projects to boost innovation. Alongside his research interests Steve is lead for Outputs for the University of Cambridge’s
              submission for REF2021. Steve has broader interests in the use of evidence in policy; and approaches to visualising concepts
              and data. Previously, Steve worked at the Centre for Science Policy as Lead for Research; and at RAND Europe where he was 
              Director of the Innovation Health and Science team. He advises on various projects around the assessment of research.

            <p class="text">
              Mollie Etheridge is a PhD researcher in the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge. Her doctoral research explores how
              the transition to parenthood and/or desired parenthood changes academics’ engagement with the norms of academic labour. Mollie
              has an expertise in feminist social theory, which she combines with her qualitative methodological background to practice creative
              forms of inquiry, including screenplay methods, body-mapping and word association. Mollie is currently following her passion for
              understanding and improving the processes of knowledge production by working as a Research Assistant on the Action Research for
              Research Culture project.
